Budgeting App

- In an effort to learn node.js better. My plan is to create an app using node.js to serve a budgeting app.

#### Objective:
With this budgeting app I would like to serve an html page that takes the following inputs:
- Revenue/Income
- Taxes
- Gross Revenue
- Expenses
- Money left over.


#### Perferable tech stack:
Node.js as runtime, html/css (Using Grid), JSON to save data. Possiblly using MongoDB.
